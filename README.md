# ImprovedPythonSS
These files perform encryption, decryption, and character occurence count in Python. Encyrpting.py and Decrypting.py perform python-based encryption/decryption using Ceaser Cipher algorithm. Encrypting.py encrypts ceaser1.txt and stores in out1.txt while decrypting.py decrypts ceaser2.txt and stores in out2.txt
