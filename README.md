# ImprovedPythonSS
These files perform encryption, decryption, and character occurence count in Python. Encyrption.py and Decryption perform python-based encryption/decryption using Ceaser Cipher algorithm. Encryption.py encrypts ceaser1.txt and stores in outside1.txt while decryption.py decrypts ceaser2.txt and stores in outside2.txt
